Space repetition learning enables you to learn a new language and retain the information at a higher rate. 
To begin the person learing starts with a new word and the more often that the word is correctly guessed, the less they see that word and if they happen to guess a word incorrectly then the more often they will see the word to help them master it. This client app use conditional rending to show scores, results of guesses, and correct translation. The server-side uses a linked-list. 

Stack This app was created using: React, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, React Router, and Git.
